## Hello my name is Jafet

 I am an artificial intelligence engineer in training with
 experience in web development, asynchronous
 programming, and cloud architectures. Specialized in
 machine learning, neural architecture search (NAS), and bio
inspired algorithms. I have worked on the design of
 interactive applications, database management (relational
 and non-relational), and cybersecurity. I'm passionate about
 automation and the research of AI models.

I have experience working on web projects both as a team leader and a freelancer, 
participating in all stages of the development lifecycle — from requirements gathering to deployment and testing.

I earned my technical degree in Programming from _Centro de Estudios Científicos y Tecnológicos No. 9 “Juan de Dios Bátiz”_. 
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering at the_ Escuela Superior de Cómputo_, 
part of the _Instituto Politécnico Nacional_.
